# TaskFlow Constitution

<!-- Vue 3 + Tailwind CSS Todo/Task Management Application -->

## Core Principles

### I. Performance-First User Experience

**MUST** deliver sub-200ms response times for all core user interactions (task creation, completion, filtering). **MUST** maintain 60fps animations and transitions. **MUST** support offline functionality with local data persistence. **MUST** be fully responsive across mobile (320px+), tablet (768px+), and desktop (1024px+) breakpoints. **MUST** meet WCAG 2.1 AA accessibility standards with keyboard navigation, screen reader support, and sufficient color contrast ratios.

### II. Component-Driven Architecture (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**MUST** use Vue 3 Composition API with TypeScript for all components. **MUST** follow atomic design principles: atoms (BaseInput, BaseButton), molecules (TaskItem, ActivityCard), organisms (TodoList, Dashboard), templates (MainLayout, AuthLayout). **MUST** implement single-file components with `<script setup>` syntax. **MUST** maintain component isolation with props/emits contracts and no direct DOM manipulation.

### III. Test-Driven Development (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

**MUST** write tests before implementation following Red-Green-Refactor cycle. **MUST** achieve 90%+ code coverage with unit tests (Vitest), integration tests (Vue Test Utils), and E2E tests (Playwright). **MUST** test user interactions, state changes, and component behavior. **MUST** validate accessibility with automated a11y testing. All tests **MUST** pass in CI/CD pipeline before merge.

### IV. State Management Discipline

**MUST** use Pinia for global state management with strict module boundaries (auth, tasks, activities, habits). **MUST** implement reactive composables for component-level state. **MUST** persist critical data to localStorage with error handling. **MUST** maintain single source of truth for each data domain. **MUST** implement optimistic updates with rollback capability.

### V. Security & Data Integrity

**MUST** validate all user inputs on both client and server sides. **MUST** sanitize data to prevent XSS attacks. **MUST** implement proper error boundaries to prevent data corruption. **MUST** handle concurrent modifications gracefully with conflict resolution. **MUST** encrypt sensitive data in localStorage. **MUST** implement proper session management for authenticated features.

## User Experience & Performance Standards

### Performance Requirements

- **Core Actions**: <200ms response time for task CRUD operations
- **Page Load**: <2s initial load time, <500ms subsequent navigation
- **Animations**: 60fps for all transitions and micro-interactions
- **Bundle Size**: <500KB initial bundle, lazy load non-critical features
- **Memory Usage**: <100MB peak memory consumption

### Responsiveness Requirements

- **Mobile**: 320px-767px with touch-optimized interactions
- **Tablet**: 768px-1023px with hybrid touch/mouse support
- **Desktop**: 1024px+ with keyboard shortcuts and mouse interactions
- **Breakpoints**: Use Tailwind's responsive utilities, avoid custom media queries

### Accessibility Standards

- **WCAG 2.1 AA Compliance**: Color contrast ratio ≥4.5:1, keyboard navigation support
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper ARIA labels, semantic HTML structure
- **Focus Management**: Visible focus indicators, logical tab order
- **Alternative Text**: Descriptive alt text for all images and icons

### Offline Capability

- **Local Storage**: Persist tasks, activities, and user preferences
- **Sync Strategy**: Queue changes for sync when connection restored
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation with user feedback
- **Data Recovery**: Backup/restore functionality for critical data

## Code Quality & Maintainability

### TypeScript Standards

- **Strict Mode**: Enable all strict TypeScript compiler options
- **Type Coverage**: 100% type coverage, no `any` types allowed
- **Interface Design**: Clear contracts between components and services
- **Generic Types**: Use generics for reusable components and utilities

### Code Style & Formatting

- **ESLint Configuration**: Vue 3 + TypeScript rules with strict mode
- **Prettier Integration**: Consistent code formatting across all files
- **Import Organization**: Group imports (Vue, libraries, local) with clear separation
- **Naming Conventions**: PascalCase for components, camelCase for functions, kebab-case for files

### Component Architecture

- **Single Responsibility**: Each component has one clear purpose
- **Composition over Inheritance**: Use composables for shared logic
- **Props Validation**: Strict prop types with default values
- **Event Handling**: Clear emit contracts with typed event payloads

### Testing Requirements

- **Unit Tests**: 90%+ coverage for all components and utilities
- **Integration Tests**: Test component interactions and data flow
- **E2E Tests**: Critical user journeys with Playwright
- **Accessibility Tests**: Automated a11y testing with axe-core
- **Performance Tests**: Lighthouse CI for performance regression detection

## State & Data Management

### Pinia Store Structure

- **Module Boundaries**: Separate stores for auth, tasks, activities, habits, settings
- **State Shape**: Normalized data structure with clear relationships
- **Actions**: Async operations with proper error handling
- **Getters**: Computed properties for derived state
- **Mutations**: Synchronous state updates only

### Data Persistence Strategy

- **Primary Storage**: localStorage for immediate persistence
- **Backup Strategy**: IndexedDB for larger datasets and offline capability
- **Sync Protocol**: Queue-based sync with conflict resolution
- **Data Migration**: Version-aware schema evolution

### Reactive Patterns

- **Composables**: Extract reusable reactive logic
- **Computed Properties**: Derived state with caching
- **Watchers**: Side effects with proper cleanup
- **Refs vs Reactive**: Use appropriate reactivity primitives

## Security & Data Integrity

### Input Validation

- **Client-Side**: Real-time validation with user feedback
- **Server-Side**: Comprehensive validation for all endpoints
- **Schema Validation**: Use Zod or similar for runtime type checking
- **Sanitization**: Clean all user inputs before processing

### XSS Protection

- **Content Security Policy**: Strict CSP headers
- **Template Security**: Use Vue's built-in XSS protection
- **Dynamic Content**: Sanitize any user-generated HTML
- **Third-Party Libraries**: Audit dependencies for vulnerabilities

### Data Consistency

- **Optimistic Updates**: Immediate UI updates with rollback capability
- **Conflict Resolution**: Last-write-wins with user notification
- **Transaction Safety**: Atomic operations for critical data changes
- **Backup Strategy**: Regular data exports and recovery procedures

## Scalability & Architecture
