# Workflow Guidelines

## Development Workflow

### Branch Strategy
- `main` - Production branch
- `develop` - Development branch
- Feature branches: `feature/[feature-name]`
- Bugfix branches: `bugfix/[bug-description]`
- Hotfix branches: `hotfix/[fix-description]`

### Development Process
1. Create a new branch from `develop`
2. Develop and test your feature
3. Run linting and tests
4. Create a Pull Request
5. Code Review
6. Merge to develop

### Commit Guidelines
- Use conventional commits format:
  - `feat:` for new features
  - `fix:` for bug fixes
  - `docs:` for documentation
  - `style:` for formatting
  - `refactor:` for code refactoring
  - `test:` for adding tests
  - `chore:` for maintenance

### Pull Request Process
1. Ensure all tests pass
2. Update relevant documentation
3. Get at least one code review
4. Squash commits if necessary
5. Merge using squash and merge strategy

### Development Environment Setup
1. Node.js 16+ required
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Run development server: `npm run dev`
4. Run tests: `npm run test`
5. Run linting: `npm run lint`
