# Implementation Plan: Make Labels Feature Fully Functional

**Branch**: `001-make-labels-feature` | **Date**: 2025-01-27 | **Spec**: [link]
**Input**: Feature specification from `/specs/001-make-labels-feature/spec.md`

## Execution Flow (/plan command scope)

```
1. Load feature spec from Input path
   → If not found: ERROR "No feature spec at {path}"
2. Fill Technical Context (scan for NEEDS CLARIFICATION)
   → Detect Project Type from file system structure or context (web=frontend+backend, mobile=app+api)
   → Set Structure Decision based on project type
3. Fill the Constitution Check section based on the content of the constitution document.
4. Evaluate Constitution Check section below
   → If violations exist: Document in Complexity Tracking
   → If no justification possible: ERROR "Simplify approach first"
   → Update Progress Tracking: Initial Constitution Check
5. Execute Phase 0 → research.md
   → If NEEDS CLARIFICATION remain: ERROR "Resolve unknowns"
6. Execute Phase 1 → contracts, data-model.md, quickstart.md, agent-specific template file (e.g., `CLAUDE.md` for Claude Code, `.github/copilot-instructions.md` for GitHub Copilot, `GEMINI.md` for Gemini CLI, `QWEN.md` for Qwen Code or `AGENTS.md` for opencode).
7. Re-evaluate Constitution Check section
   → If new violations: Refactor design, return to Phase 1
   → Update Progress Tracking: Post-Design Constitution Check
8. Plan Phase 2 → Describe task generation approach (DO NOT create tasks.md)
9. STOP - Ready for /tasks command
```

**IMPORTANT**: The /plan command STOPS at step 7. Phases 2-4 are executed by other commands:

- Phase 2: /tasks command creates tasks.md
- Phase 3-4: Implementation execution (manual or via tools)

## Summary

Implement a fully functional labels system for task categorization and filtering. Users can create, edit, and delete labels with names and colors, assign multiple labels to tasks, and filter tasks by labels using OR/AND logic. The system maintains performance with 2,000 tasks and 200 labels while providing full accessibility compliance.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: TypeScript 5.0+ with Vue 3 Composition API  
**Primary Dependencies**: Vue 3, Pinia, Tailwind CSS, Vite, Vitest, Vue Test Utils, Playwright  
**Storage**: localStorage with IndexedDB backup, repository abstraction for future API migration  
**Testing**: Vitest (unit), Vue Test Utils (integration), Playwright (E2E), axe-core (a11y)  
**Target Platform**: Modern browsers (ES2020+), responsive web (320px+ mobile, 768px+ tablet, 1024px+ desktop)  
**Project Type**: Single-page web application (Vue 3 + Vite)  
**Performance Goals**: <200ms core actions, 60fps animations, <2s initial load, <500ms navigation  
**Constraints**: 200 labels max, 12 labels per task (warn at 12, block at 20), WCAG 2.1 AA compliance  
**Scale/Scope**: 2,000 tasks, 200 labels, 60fps performance, offline-capable with local persistence

## Constitution Check

_GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design._

### Performance Requirements

**Structure Decision**: Single-page Vue 3 application with modular feature structure. Labels feature integrated into existing modules structure with dedicated components, stores, and types. Testing follows TDD approach with unit, integration, and E2E test layers.

## Phase 0: Outline & Research

1. **Extract unknowns from Technical Context** above:
   - For each NEEDS CLARIFICATION → research task
   - For each dependency → best practices task
   - For each integration → patterns task

2. **Generate and dispatch research agents**:

   ```
   For each unknown in Technical Context:
     Task: "Research {unknown} for {feature context}"
   For each technology choice:
     Task: "Find best practices for {tech} in {domain}"
   ```

3. **Consolidate findings** in `research.md` using format:
   - Decision: [what was chosen]
   - Rationale: [why chosen]
   - Alternatives considered: [what else evaluated]

**Output**: research.md with all NEEDS CLARIFICATION resolved

## Phase 1: Design & Contracts

_Prerequisites: research.md complete_

1. **Extract entities from feature spec** → `data-model.md`:
   - Entity name, fields, relationships
   - Validation rules from requirements
   - State transitions if applicable

2. **Generate API contracts** from functional requirements:
   - For each user action → endpoint
   - Use standard REST/GraphQL patterns
   - Output OpenAPI/GraphQL schema to `/contracts/`

3. **Generate contract tests** from contracts:
   - One test file per endpoint
   - Assert request/response schemas
   - Tests must fail (no implementation yet)

4. **Extract test scenarios** from user stories:
   - Each story → integration test scenario
   - Quickstart test = story validation steps

5. **Update agent file incrementally** (O(1) operation):
   - Run `.specify/scripts/bash/update-agent-context.sh cursor`
     **IMPORTANT**: Execute it exactly as specified above. Do not add or remove any arguments.
   - If exists: Add only NEW tech from current plan
   - Preserve manual additions between markers
   - Update recent changes (keep last 3)
   - Keep under 150 lines for token efficiency
   - Output to repository root

**Output**: data-model.md, /contracts/\*, failing tests, quickstart.md, agent-specific file

## Phase 2: Task Planning Approach

_This section describes what the /tasks command will do - DO NOT execute during /plan_

**Task Generation Strategy**:

- Load `.specify/templates/tasks-template.md` as base
- Generate tasks from Phase 1 design docs (contracts, data model, quickstart)
- Each contract → contract test task [P]
- Each entity → model creation task [P]
- Each user story → integration test task
- Implementation tasks to make tests pass

**Ordering Strategy**:

- TDD order: Tests before implementation
- Dependency order: Models before services before UI
- Mark [P] for parallel execution (independent files)

**Estimated Output**: 25-30 numbered, ordered tasks in tasks.md

**IMPORTANT**: This phase is executed by the /tasks command, NOT by /plan

### Specific Task Categories for Labels Feature

**Setup Tasks**:

- Vue 3 + TypeScript project configuration
- Pinia store setup for labels
- Tailwind CSS configuration for label styling
- Testing framework setup (Vitest, Vue Test Utils, Playwright)

**Test-First Tasks**:

- Unit tests for label store operations (CRUD, validation)
- Component tests for LabelChip, LabelPicker, LabelDialog
- Integration tests for label assignment and filtering
- E2E tests for complete user workflows
- Accessibility tests for keyboard navigation and screen readers

**Core Implementation Tasks**:

- Label entity and TypeScript interfaces
- Pinia labels store with CRUD operations
- Extended tasks store for label associations
- Repository pattern for localStorage persistence
- Data migration for existing tasks

**UI Component Tasks**:

- BaseLabelChip component with accessibility
- LabelPicker with type-ahead search
- LabelDialog for create/edit operations
- LabelFilter with OR/AND logic
- LabelManagement page component

**Integration Tasks**:

- Router configuration for label management
- Layout integration for label components
- localStorage persistence implementation
- Error handling and user feedback
- Performance optimization (computed maps, debouncing)

**Polish Tasks**:

- Performance testing and optimization
- Accessibility audit and fixes
- Code coverage verification
- Documentation updates
- Manual testing and validation

## Phase 3+: Future Implementation

_These phases are beyond the scope of the /plan command_

**Phase 3**: Task execution (/tasks command creates tasks.md)  
**Phase 4**: Implementation (execute tasks.md following constitutional principles)  
**Phase 5**: Validation (run tests, execute quickstart.md, performance validation)

## Complexity Tracking

_Fill ONLY if Constitution Check has violations that must be justified_

| Violation                  | Why Needed         | Simpler Alternative Rejected Because |
| -------------------------- | ------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| [e.g., 4th project]        | [current need]     | [why 3 projects insufficient]        |
| [e.g., Repository pattern] | [specific problem] | [why direct DB access insufficient]  |
