# Feature Specification: Make Labels Feature Fully Functional

**Feature Branch**: `001-make-labels-feature`  
**Created**: 2025-01-27  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Make Labels feature fully functional"

## Execution Flow (main)

```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements

- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation

When creating this spec from a user prompt:

1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing _(mandatory)_

### Primary User Story

As a task management user, I want to create and assign labels to my tasks so I can organize and filter them by categories, making it easier to find and manage related tasks.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** I am on the labels management page, **When** I create a new label with name "Work" and color "#22c55e", **Then** the label appears in the labels list and I can assign it to tasks
2. **Given** I have a task with no labels, **When** I edit the task and assign the "Work" label, **Then** the task shows the label as a colored chip and the label is saved
3. **Given** I have multiple tasks with different labels, **When** I filter by the "Work" label, **Then** only tasks with the "Work" label are displayed
4. **Given** I have a label assigned to 5 tasks, **When** I delete the label and confirm, **Then** the label is removed from all tasks and no tasks are deleted
5. **Given** I have tasks with multiple labels, **When** I apply multiple label filters with AND logic, **Then** only tasks containing all selected labels are shown

### Edge Cases

- What happens when I try to create a label with a name that already exists?
- How does the system handle when I reach the maximum number of labels (200)?
- What happens when I try to assign more than 12 labels to a single task?
- How does the system handle invalid color codes or empty label names?
- What happens when I delete a label that is currently being used as a filter?

## Requirements _(mandatory)_

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST allow users to create labels with unique names (1-32 characters) and colors
- **FR-002**: System MUST prevent duplicate label names (case-insensitive) and show appropriate error messages
- **FR-003**: Users MUST be able to edit existing labels (rename and recolor) without losing task associations
- **FR-004**: Users MUST be able to delete labels with confirmation dialog showing affected task count
- **FR-005**: System MUST allow users to assign multiple labels to any task (up to 12 labels per task)
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide label filtering with single or multi-select options
- **FR-007**: System MUST support both OR and AND filtering logic for multiple label selection
- **FR-008**: System MUST persist all labels and label assignments across browser sessions
- **FR-009**: System MUST migrate existing tasks to include empty labelIds array on first load
- **FR-010**: System MUST enforce maximum limits (200 labels total, 12 labels per task with warning at 12, block at 20)
- **FR-011**: System MUST validate color inputs (3/6-digit HEX) and auto-select contrasting text colors
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide accessible keyboard navigation for all label interactions
- **FR-013**: System MUST show label chips with color indicators and accessible names
- **FR-014**: System MUST maintain 60fps performance with up to 2,000 tasks and 200 labels
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide type-ahead search for label selection with 150ms debounce

### Key Entities _(include if feature involves data)_

- **Label**: Represents a categorization tag with unique identifier, name, and color. Used to group and filter tasks. Has relationships to multiple tasks through labelIds array.
- **Task**: Extended entity that includes labelIds array to track which labels are assigned. Maintains existing task properties while adding label association capability.
