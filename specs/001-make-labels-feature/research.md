# Research: Labels Feature Implementation

## Technology Decisions

### Vue 3 Composition API with TypeScript

**Decision**: Use Vue 3 Composition API with `<script setup>` syntax and TypeScript strict mode for all label components.

**Rationale**:

- Provides better type safety for label data structures and component props
- Composition API offers better code organization for complex label filtering logic
- `<script setup>` reduces boilerplate and improves developer experience
- Aligns with project constitution requirements for Vue 3 + TypeScript

**Alternatives considered**:

- Options API: Rejected due to less type safety and more verbose syntax
- JavaScript: Rejected due to lack of type safety for complex label operations

### Pinia Store Architecture

**Decision**: Create dedicated `useLabelsStore` with separate module boundaries and extend `useTasksStore` for label associations.

**Rationale**:

- Maintains single source of truth for labels data
- Enables reactive label filtering across components
- Supports optimistic updates with rollback capability
- Follows constitution requirements for Pinia module boundaries

**Alternatives considered**:

- Vuex: Rejected due to more verbose syntax and less TypeScript support
- Local component state: Rejected due to need for cross-component label sharing

### localStorage with Repository Pattern

**Decision**: Implement localStorage persistence with repository abstraction layer for future API migration.

**Rationale**:

- Provides immediate offline functionality
- Repository pattern enables easy migration to backend API
- localStorage is sufficient for 200 labels and 2,000 tasks
- Supports data migration for existing tasks

**Alternatives considered**:

- IndexedDB: Considered for larger datasets but localStorage sufficient for current scale
- Direct API calls: Rejected due to offline requirement and current single-page app architecture

### Tailwind CSS Design System

**Decision**: Use Tailwind utility classes with design tokens for label styling and responsive design.

**Rationale**:

- Consistent with existing project styling approach
- Provides responsive design utilities for mobile-first label management
- Supports dark mode with design token system
- Enables accessible color contrast ratios

**Alternatives considered**:

- Custom CSS: Rejected due to maintenance overhead and inconsistency
- CSS-in-JS: Rejected due to performance concerns and Tailwind preference

### Testing Strategy

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive testing with Vitest (unit), Vue Test Utils (integration), and Playwright (E2E).

**Rationale**:

- Vitest provides fast unit testing with Vue 3 support
- Vue Test Utils enables component integration testing
- Playwright ensures end-to-end user journey validation
- Achieves 90%+ code coverage requirement

**Alternatives considered**:

- Jest: Rejected due to slower performance and less Vue 3 optimization
- Cypress: Considered but Playwright chosen for better cross-browser support

## Performance Optimizations

### Computed Maps for Label Lookups

**Decision**: Use computed properties to create labelIdâ†’label maps for O(1) lookups instead of O(n) array searches.

**Rationale**:

- Essential for maintaining 60fps with 2,000 tasks and 200 labels
- Reduces rendering complexity for label chips and filtering
- Leverages Vue's reactivity system for automatic updates

### Debounced Type-ahead Search

**Decision**: Implement 150ms debounce for label search to prevent excessive filtering operations.

**Rationale**:

- Reduces computational overhead during user typing
- Maintains responsive feel while preventing performance issues
- Standard UX pattern for search functionality

### Virtual Scrolling Consideration

**Decision**: Monitor performance and implement virtual scrolling if label lists exceed 100 items.

**Rationale**:

- Proactive approach to maintain 60fps performance
- Virtual scrolling only needed if label management UI becomes slow
- Can be implemented incrementally without breaking existing functionality

## Accessibility Implementation

### Keyboard Navigation

**Decision**: Implement full keyboard navigation for all label interactions including dropdowns, filters, and management.

**Rationale**:

- Required for WCAG 2.1 AA compliance
- Essential for screen reader users
- Improves overall user experience

### Color Contrast

**Decision**: Auto-calculate contrasting text colors (black/white) for label chips based on background color.

**Rationale**:

- Ensures readable text on all label background colors
- Meets WCAG 2.1 AA contrast ratio requirements
- Provides consistent visual experience

### ARIA Labels

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive ARIA labels for all label components and interactions.

**Rationale**:

- Required for screen reader accessibility
- Provides clear context for label operations
- Follows semantic HTML structure

## Data Migration Strategy

### Existing Task Migration

**Decision**: Automatically add empty `labelIds: []` array to existing tasks on first load.

**Rationale**:

- Non-breaking change to existing task data
- Enables immediate label functionality
- Simple migration that doesn't affect existing functionality

### Version-aware Persistence

**Decision**: Use versioned localStorage keys (`labels:v1`) for future schema evolution.

**Rationale**:

- Enables future data structure changes
- Provides migration path for breaking changes
- Maintains backward compatibility

## Error Handling

### Input Validation

**Decision**: Implement comprehensive client-side validation for label names and colors with immediate feedback.

**Rationale**:

- Prevents invalid data from entering the system
- Provides better user experience with immediate feedback
- Reduces error states and data corruption

### Graceful Degradation

**Decision**: Implement fallback behavior for localStorage failures and provide user feedback.

**Rationale**:

- Ensures application remains functional even with storage issues
- Provides clear error messages for user awareness
- Maintains data integrity through error boundaries
