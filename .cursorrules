# Cursor Rules Documentation

This file serves as both documentation for the `.cursor/rules` directory structure and for backward compatibility with the legacy `.cursorrules` approach. It also serves as an entrypoint for CLAUDE.md or other AI tools to understand the .cursor/rules folder that is the main agents knowledge base.

## Structure of `.cursor/rules`

Rules in the `.cursor/rules` directory follow this structure:

- File extension: `.mdc`
- File format: Markdown with YAML frontmatter

### Frontmatter Structure

Each rule file has a YAML frontmatter section at the top with these properties:

```
---
description: Brief description of what the rule does
globs: **/*.js, **/*.ts # File patterns this rule applies to
alwaysApply: true # Whether this rule should always be applied regardless of file context
---
```

### Rule Content

After the frontmatter, the main content is markdown:

```markdown
# Your rule title

- You can reference other files using @file syntax
- You can organize rules by purpose (e.g., standards, workflows)
- Rules can contain code examples, guidelines, or architectural decisions
```

## Organization

Rules are organized in the `.cursor/rules` directory:
- Task-specific rules should be placed in `.cursor/rules/tasks/`
- General rules can be placed directly in `.cursor/rules/`

## How Rules Are Applied

1. Rules matching the current file(s) via glob patterns are automatically included
2. Rules with `alwaysApply: true` are included in all contexts
3. When referencing a file that matches a rule, that rule is included as context

## Creating New Rules

Use the command palette (Cmd + Shift + P) > New Cursor Rule to create a new rule file with the proper structure.
